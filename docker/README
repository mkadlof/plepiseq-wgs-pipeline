alphafold dockerfile that
1. works on compute and was used to build alphafold:1.1 image
2. to build alphaphold, copy MKADLOF repo ~mkadlof/alphafold, substitute file from docker/ from that repo to this file and follow instructions from alphafold repo.
3. This is a TEMPORAL solution
Why
1. Novel repo is not compatible with cuda installed of this machine and avarything > ver 11.2 causes docker error (when docker run)
2. Curretn alphafold repo when build using 11.2 image has incompatible version of cudnn (it requires cudann 990+ and the base image has 910) (i dont remember exact versins)
Solution
1. Update cuda and cuda toolkit on this machine , then probably docker image with novel cuda should work
