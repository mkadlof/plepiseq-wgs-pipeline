here we will put all files required by nextalign i.e. genome (again) + gff file
# for SARS and MN we use again use predefined files 
# for influenza we create gff ourselved. However we do need to create gff for each subtype/clade, subtype level files should suffice to produce valid proteins sequence for a sample
# genome present prior to 08.01.2025 are not based on genomes from data/common/snpEff/data/
# but they are still OK (the "old" datam might include only CDS which are ok, we dont need anything else to get protein sequence)

# In retrospective for nextalign we don't need to provide data for each clade , subtype-level should be eough for nextalign program to align "our" segment with "reference" segment and produce valid protein sequence. Even if we were to provide "reference" on a clade-level the alignment wouldn't change that much ...

For following new subtypes not orignially present we use following data:

H1, H5, H6 and H9 data are based on reference genome for H1N1_6b1a5a2a1 from data/common/snpEff/data/ dir
1. The procedure is straight
a. We split genome into subfastas with segments (HA.fasta, NA.fasta ...)
cat sequences.fa  | awk '{if (substr($0, 1, 1)==">") { filename=(substr($0,7) ".fasta"); print $0 >> filename } else {print toupper($0)  >> filename}}'
b. we modify gtf to gff (we save only gene feature)
cat genes.gtf  | awk '{if ($3=="gene") print $0}' | sed s'/id /id=/'g | tr -d '"' >> ${subtype}.gff
c. We MANUALLY add M2 data for custom script (nextalign cannot  handle frameshifts). WE do that by aligninf M2 segment to KNOWN M2 sequence (preferably from this type, but M2 is kind a conserved so even full M2 from H3 is ok). I used blast from ncbu (remember to increse e-value to 100 and decrease word size to 2) this way we will get alignment of both 1-40 segment and 700+ segment in the alignment section
d For B/ the mechanism of M1/M2 is different. The last nucleotide of the stop codon of M1, serves as the first nucleotide of the start codon of M2 (so frame of M2 /BM2 to be precise/ is different than that of M1). But unlike A/ the cds is continous, however, i still use "exon" in name so my script can correctly process this protein.
